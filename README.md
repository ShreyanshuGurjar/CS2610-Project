This is a simulation engine of a 5-staged scalar pipelined processor.

To run this code, put the input files "ICache.txt", "DCache.txt"  "RF.txt" in the input folder.
"ICache.txt" contains 256 byte instruction cache.
"DCache.txt" contains 256 byte data cache.
"RF.txt" contains register content of sixteen 8-bit registers.

Compile using g++ main.cpp.

Executable a.out will be generated and then execute it by ./a.out in the terminal.

Then the "Output.txt" and updated "DCache.txt" will be generated in output folder.
